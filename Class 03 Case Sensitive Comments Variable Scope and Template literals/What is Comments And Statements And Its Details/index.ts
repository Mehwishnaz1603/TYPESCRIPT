// Comments:
// Single line TypeScript comments start with two forward slashes (//).
// All text after the two forward slashes until the end of a line makes up a comment
// Even when there are forward slashes in the commented text.
// Multi-line Comments
// Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
// Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

// Statements:
// A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
// In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
// A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
// TypeScript applications consist of statements with an appropriate syntax. A single statement may span 
// multiple lines. Multiple statements may occur on a single line if each statement is separated by a semicolon.
